% this is a wrapper function to run the NextState.m function

% This function helps in estimating the state of the robot at the next state
% It takes current state, velocity, timestep, and max vel as input arguments
% It returns next state of the robot as an output

%% Next State

T = 1;   % Robot run time
max_iterations = T/time_step;

% Joint and wheel velocities
% velocity = [u1, u2, u3, u4, J1_dot, J2_dot, J3_dot, J4_dot, J5_dot];
velocity = [10, 10, 10, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];

% initializing the next state
